        <h3>Personal Background</h3>
        <p>Hi, I am Aidan McLain. I have lived in North Carolina for nearly all my life and was born in Wilmington, N.C. For most of my educational career I have been homeschooled, which eventually allowed me to dual enroll in high school and graduate with an associates degree.</p>
        <p>I am a big fan of game development, so much so that I sometimes find it more interesting to learn about how a game works than actually playing it. Also, I enjoy old mafia movies like the godfather and goodfellas.</p>
        </li>

        <h3>Academic Background</h3>
        <p> I am currently working towards receiving my bachelors of arts degree in computer science and already hold an associate of arts degree.</p>
