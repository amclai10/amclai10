            <h3><a href="https://www.economist.com" target="_blank">The Economist</a></h3>
            <p>The Economist is a global newspaper that covers geopolitics, finance, economics, and tech. They were founded in 1843 with the goal of promoting free trade.</p>

                    <strong>Contrast</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Every page has incredible contrast. All text is easily readable, headers stick out and make it easy to navigate the site, and font choices make sense.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Repetition</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All of their pages seemingly follow the same layout and design. There is a well defined flow and format used by the Economist that they consistently follow.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alignment</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Alignment makes sense throughout the site. They have large margins on the left and right of the page and keep the articles in the centered main.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Proximity</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They use screen real estate very effectively. There is no unnecessary white space and page content is kept relatively close.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://www.pnwx.com">Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.</a></h3>
            <p>
                Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc. sells all kinds of products related to X-Rays; this includes lead glass, radiation reducing gloves, and animal immobilizers. They are located in Gresham, Oregon.

                    <strong>Contrast</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The contrast on this site is terrible. They have made the decision to use a repeating background image that makes it difficult to read the text.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Repetition</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Repetition was clearly an afterthought when designing this site. None of the pages have a similar layout and only resemble each other by using the same hideous style throughout.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alignment</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They have extremely poor alignment on all of their pages. They. Have centered paragraphs, weirdly aligned images, and have no sense of consistency.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Proximity</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Proximity of information is very poorly handled. There is an abundance of white space on every site that makes information difficult to find.</li>
                    </ul>
