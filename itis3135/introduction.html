                    <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
                    <p>I am a big fan of game development, so much so that I sometimes find it more interesting to learn about how a game works than actually playing it. Also, I enjoy old mafia movies like the godfather and goodfellas.</p>

                    <h3>Personal Background</h3>
                    <p>Hi, I am Aidan McLain. I have lived in North Carolina for nearly all my life and was born in Wilmington, N.C. For most of my educational career I have been homeschooled, which eventually allowed me to dual enroll in high school and graduate with an associates degree.</p>

                    <h3>Professional Background</h3>
                    <p>Only being 18 years old, my professional background is not exactly an extensive one. I have worked at a couple restaurants, starting with the food and beverage department at Hershey Park in 2022. I also worked at Chick-Fil-A from late 2022 to 2025.</p>
                </li>

                    <h3>Academic Background</h3>
                    <p>I am currently working towards receiving my bachelors of arts degree in computer science and already hold an associate of arts degree.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Background in Web Development</h3>
                    <p>I do not have a particularly extensive background in web development. Outside of occasionally tinkering with HTML and watching some tutorials on it, I have not done anything in regards to developing websites.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Primary Computer</h3>
                    <p>Apple 2024 Mac Mini with an M4 processor running off MacOS which I exclusively use in my dorm room. I also regularly use my Apple Macbook Air 2024 with an M3 processor, also running off MacOS, whenever I am in an environment where the Mac Mini is inaccessible.</p>
